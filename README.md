# Muk
kind of a different approach to the creeper world concept.

Its just some idea I had for a game, wanted to get something started and maybe it will go somewhere. 

Muk
The muk spawns from gyzers over the planets surface. its thick and toxic but it makes great building and energy materials!

Muk material can be used to construct primal resources, which is needed to build all sorts of facilities and armies to defend our muk stations

the problem is managing the muk...

too much muk, and it will overflow walls, rupture relays and destroy the land for a period of time, killing crops, people, and animals.
too little muk and farm lands would not beable to produce food for the population, or building material for expanding, or ammunition for our war machines.
The muk is like a living creature, it can be good or bad, depending on how we control it.  the lands we live on are elevated, 
so wild muk gysers can't reach us, but some places don't have this luxury.

when we control muk, it works for us, allowing us to build, expand, and upgrade our network.  when its out of control, we must destroy it, by any means possible.  to control a muk guyzer, it must be surrounded in control walls.
